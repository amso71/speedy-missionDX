# speedy-missionDX
A version of JustinBailey13's speedhack with basic improvement patches.
Improvements include faster item collection and faster spawning at the beginning of the game.
Original description of JustinBailey13's base speedhack:
a hack of metroid zero mission 
Top speed and acceleration have been changed for Air, Morph, and Running. 
Morph ball bounce is decreased, but not completely gone. 
With the changes made without speed booster you reach speed booster speeds in 15 frames. With it you reach this speed in 8 frames. 
Shine sparking left and right also have increased speed. So much that clipping through doors is possible. 
With all these changes a lot of items can be collected earlier than normal and routing for 100% is vastly different.
